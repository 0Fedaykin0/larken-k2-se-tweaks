# Larken's K2 & SE Tweaks

All of the following options are toggleable under Startup mod settings. Thanks to @Karoschl

- Allows K2 Steel Pipe and Underground Pipes to be placed on space platforms & spaceships
- Allows K2 50k and 200k Storage Tanks to be placed on space platforms & spaceships
- Make Space Underground Belts and Pipes the same max distance as K2
- Upgrade the Singularity Lab to have 15 base research speed (1.5x more than space lab)
- Remove the Naquium Tesseract from K2 Stabilizer Recipe
- SE nerfs K2 this by making matter assembly twice as expensive. This tweak makes it only ~1.25 more expensive than K2 and makes matter cube conversions lossless.
- Makes K2 Matter Stabilizers 99.5% likely to be preserved versus 99%
- Tweak matter costs for SE Resources to be 2:1 instead of 8:1
- Xon1's additional recipe for allowing electric boilers to make 415/975 steam
- Allows nixi tubes, moonlogic and improved combinator placement on space platforms
